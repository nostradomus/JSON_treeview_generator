# JSON treeview generator

## What

This command-line tool converts JSON-data into a text-based treeview. The JSON-data can be originating from either a (local) file or directly from a web-api.

## Why

When learning a new programming language, I prefer writing code which can actually serve in the future, instead of just writing hello world's. So, the language being PHP, I considered some web-related tool to be interesting enough.

## How

Coming soon.............

## Progress status

 - [x] have an [idea](#what), and a [reason](#why) why to make it
 - [x] decide on how it should [work](#how)
 - [x] write the [code](source/)  
 - [x] [test](#how) it properly
 - [x] document the [functionalities](#help) and the [code](source/)
 - [ ] write an [end-user manual](https://github.com/nostradomus/LHCreate-2017/wiki)

## How to use it

Coming soon.............

## Technical details

#### Programming language

The code has been written in PHP. The minimum required version is PHP 5.3, due to the use of HereDoc/NowDoc. The script has however been tested to work correctly up to version 7.

#### Code

The source code is available in the [source folder](source/) :

version  | name             | description
---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0.0 | jsonTreeview.php | initial version

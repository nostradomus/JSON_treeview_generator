## What

This command-line tool converts [JSON](https://www.json.org)-data into a text-based treeview. The [JSON](https://www.json.org)-data can be originating from either a (local) file or directly from a web-api.

## Why

When learning a new programming language, I prefer writing code which can actually serve in the future, instead of just writing hello world's. So, the language being [PHP](https://secure.php.net), I considered some web-related tool to be interesting enough.

## How

Coming soon.............

## Progress status

 - [x] have an [idea](#what), and a [reason](#why) why to make it
 - [x] decide on how it should [work](#how)
 - [x] write the [code](source/)  
 - [x] [test](#how) it properly
 - [x] document the [functionalities](#help) and the [code](source/)
 - [ ] write an [end-user manual](https://github.com/nostradomus/LHCreate-2017/wiki)

## How to use it

Starting the application with the `--help` option as argument will display the concerning [linux man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page). Always refer to the [man page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) which is generated by the script you are running for the most relevant instructions (i.e. specific availability of options for the version you are running).

`>php jsonTreeview.php --help`

JSON TREEVIEW GENERATOR (1)            General Commands Manual            JSON TREEVIEW GENERATOR (1)

NAME
       jsonTreeview - generate a text-based treeview for json-data originating from file or web

SYNOPSIS
       jsonTreeview [-h]
       jsonTreeview [-v]
       jsonTreeview [-f file] {--valueonly}
       jsonTreeview [-u url] {--valueonly}

DESCRIPTION
       jsonTreeview is a tool to generate text-based treeviews for json-data originating
       from either a file or a web-API.

       Options -f and -u, followed by either a path/filename or a web-address, will allow
       the tool to go get the json-data to transform into a text-based treeview, as
       displayed below :

       http://www.thewebaddress/data.json or /pathname/filename.json
             |_firstelementkey
                |_firstdatalinekey : 1234
                |_seconddatalinekey : abcde
                |_...
             |_secondelementkey
                |_firstdatalinekey : 5678
                |_seconddatalinekey : fghij
                |_...
             |_...

       The root tag of the treeview will refer to the origin of the json-data.
       Collection headers will display the key as label.
       Branch ends will display key/value pairs.

       When adding the --valueonly option to the commandline, a treeiew with only element values
       will be generated (no key labels). Collection headers will be labeled ARRAY.

       The -h option will display this help text.

       The -v option will display the tools software version number.

OPTIONS
       -h -H --help           display this help message
       -v -V --version        display this application's version
       -f -F --file           generate a treeview from the json-data in the file
       -u -U --url            generate a treeview from the json-data retrieved from the url
             --valueonly      generate a treeview with values only (no key labels)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Informative messages will be displayed when the application is called in
       an incorrect way (i.e. missing/unkown/invalid parameters)

AUTHOR
       This tool was created by The Nostradomus Engineering Team, for quick analysis
       of json-data from web-APIs. We can be contacted through
       http://nostradomus.ddns.net/contactform.html for any questions.

## Technical details

#### Programming language

The code has been written in [PHP](https://secure.php.net). The minimum required version is PHP 5.3, due to the use of [HereDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#PHP)/[NowDoc](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php). The script has however been tested to work correctly up to version 7.

#### Code

The source code is available in the [source folder](source/) :

version  | name             | description
---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0.0 | jsonTreeview.php | initial version

# JSON treeview generator
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/project%20status-publication%20in%20progress-lightgrey.svg) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0.0-green.svg)
## What

This command-line tool converts [JSON](https://www.json.org)-data into a text-based treeview. The [JSON](https://www.json.org)-data can be originating from either a (local) file or directly from a web-api.

## Why

When learning a new programming language, I prefer writing code which can actually serve in the future, instead of just writing hello world's. So, the language being [PHP](https://secure.php.net), I considered some web-related tool to be interesting enough.

## How

Coming soon.............

## Progress status

 - [x] have an [idea](#what), and a [reason](#why) why to make it
 - [x] decide on how it should [work](#how)
 - [x] write the [code](source/)  
 - [x] [test](#how) it properly
 - [x] document the [functionalities](#help) and the [code](source/)
 - [ ] write an [end-user manual](https://github.com/nostradomus/LHCreate-2017/wiki)

## How to use it

Coming soon.............

## Technical details

#### Programming language

The code has been written in [PHP](https://secure.php.net). The minimum required version is PHP 5.3, due to the use of [HereDoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document#PHP)/[NowDoc](http://php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php). The script has however been tested to work correctly up to version 7.

#### Code

The source code is available in the [source folder](source/) :

version  | name             | description
---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v1.0.0.0 | jsonTreeview.php | initial version
